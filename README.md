# DLpapers

**DLpapers** is a curated (actually useful) list for papers on Deep Learning with specific focus on Natural Language Understanding and Generation.

## Generative Adversarial Networks

Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a type of artificial intelligence algorithms used in unsupervised machine learning, implemented by a system of two neural networks competing against each other in a zero-sum game framework. They were first introduced by Ian Goodfellow et al. in 2014.
